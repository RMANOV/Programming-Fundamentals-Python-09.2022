# first line of input is the google income from a single search of a user
# second line of input is the number of users n
# next n lines are the number of searches of each user


# For the first user, we have one search, so we ignore the search. 
# We double the money from the second user: 10 * 5.5 * 2 = 110
# For the third user, we have 5 searches, so we triple the money per search (82.5).
# In the end, we get total money of 192.50.
# Output
# The possible outputs are:
