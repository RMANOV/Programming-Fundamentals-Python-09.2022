# Write a program that prints you a receipt for your new computer. 
# You will receive the parts' prices (without tax) until you receive what type of customer this is - special or regular. 
# Once you receive the type of customer you should print the receipt.
# The taxes are 20% of each part's price you receive. 
# If the customer is special, he has a 10% discount on the total price with taxes.
# If a given price is not a positive number, you should print "Invalid price!" on the console and continue with the next price.
# If the total price is equal to zero, you should print "Invalid order!" on the console.

# â€¢	The receipt should be in the following format: 
# "Congratulations you've just bought a new computer!
# Price without taxes: {total price without taxes}$
# Taxes: {total amount of taxes}$
# -----------
# Total price: {total price with taxes}$"
# Note: All prices should be displayed to the second digit after the decimal point! 
# The discount is applied only on the total price. Discount is only applicable to the final price!
